# verilog-series-day10-LATCHES
This repository includes Verilog implementations of level-sensitive memory elements: the SR Latch (built using basic logic gates), the D Latch, and a Gated D Latch with enable control. The modules are accompanied by testbenches, waveform simulations, and RTL schematics using Vivado.
